# An Expert System for Selecting Wart Treatment Method
Use of various machine learning algorithms such as KNN and ANN to predict the accuracy of Cryotherapy treatment on patients with wart disease under the guidance of 
Prof. Divya Kumari.
## Acknowledgement
We are profoundly grateful to Prof. Divya Kumari for her expert guidance and continuous
encouragement throughout to see that this project rights its target since its commencement to
its completion.
We would like to express our thanks and appreciation to our esteemed institution, KIIT deemed 
to be university, for giving us the opportunity to develop the project.
## About
As benign tumors, warts are made through the mediation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and 
may grow on all parts of body, especially hands and feet. There are several treatment methods 
for this illness. However, none of them can heal all patients. Consequently, physicians are 
looking for more effective and customized treatments for each patient. They are endeavoring 
to discover which treatments have better impacts on a particular patient. The aim of this study 
is to identify the appropriate treatment for two common types of warts (plantar and common) 
and to predict the responses of two of the best methods (immunotherapy and cryotherapy) to 
the treatment. The study on which this project is based was conducted on 180 patients, with 
plantar and common warts, who had referred to the dermatology clinic of Ghaem Hospital, 
Mashhad, Iran. In this study, 90 patients were treated by cryotherapy method with liquid 
nitrogen and 90 patients with immunotherapy method. The selection of the treatment method 
was made randomly. A fuzzy logic rule-based system was proposed and implemented to predict 
the responses to the treatment method. It was observed that the prediction accuracy of 
immunotherapy and cryotherapy methods was 83.33% and 80.7%, respectively. The aim of this 
project is to improve this accuracy using machine learning algorithms. According to the results 
obtained, the benefits of this expert system are multifold: assisting physicians in selecting the 
best treatment method, saving time for patients, reducing the treatment cost, and improving the 
quality of treatment.
